# PDF_scraping
- #### In this repository, I will put the Python codes to get the text from the [Lone Wolf books](https://www.projectaon.org/staff/eric/), which have recently been released by the author for free
- #### I will try to mine the block of text and identify some specific keywords, e.g., castles, goblins, forest, etc
- #### The purpose is to use the mined text for other projects
